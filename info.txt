This is my first file that i created in the local repository by 
"$touch info.txt"
it created the file info.txt and i did
"$git status"
it said that it is on master branch and no commits yet
and showed untracked files which is info.txt and that is in staging area
so now i am going to say commit on the bash to add this file to the master branch
i.e i will go and say
$git commit
