This is my first file that i created in the local repository by 
"$touch info.txt"
it created the file info.txt and i did
"$git status"
it said that it is on master branch and no commits yet
and showed untracked files which is info.txt and that is in untracked stage
so now i am going to say commit on the bash to add this file to the master branch
i.e i will go and say
$git commit
well after i said that i just typed the above command it just said initial commit on the branch master and after i 
did a status command
it said that no commits yet and
then i added the files to index by 
$git add info.txt
and it said no commits yet but it is no longer in untracking stage but in index i.e staging area
now
